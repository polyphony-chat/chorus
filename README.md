## About

Chorus is a Rust library that allows developers to interact with multiple Spacebar-compatible APIs and Gateways simultaneously. The library provides a simple and efficient way to communicate with these services, making it easier for developers to build applications that rely on them. Chorus is open-source and welcomes contributions from the community.
