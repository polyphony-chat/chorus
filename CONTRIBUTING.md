**Please refer to the [contribution guidelines](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTION_GUIDELINES.md) and [our Code of Conduct](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) before making a contribution.**

Contributions should always fork from and merge back into the `dev` branch.

Chorus is currently missing voice support and a lot of API endpoints, many of which should be trivial to implement,
ever since [we streamlined the process of doing so](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/chorus/discussions/401).

If you'd like to contribute new functionality, check out [The 'Meta'-issues.](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/chorus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+Meta%22+) They contain a comprehensive list of all features which are yet missing for full Discord.com compatibility.
Please feel free to open an Issue with the idea you have, or a Pull Request.

## Merging

All pull requests opened into the `dev` branch should be merged via the "Squash and Merge" option to keep the commit history small. Merging into the `main` branch should be done via a regular merge commit. This way, GitHub will correctly attribute contributors and count statistics for the insights tab.
