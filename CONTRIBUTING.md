Chorus is currently missing voice support and a lot of API endpoints, many of which should be trivial to implement,
ever since [we streamlined the process of doing so](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/chorus/discussions/401).

If you'd like to contribute new functionality, check out [The 'Meta'-issues.](https://github.com/polyphony-chat/chorus/issues?q=is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+Meta%22+) They contain a comprehensive list of all features which are yet missing for full Discord.com compatibility.
Please feel free to open an Issue with the idea you have, or a Pull Request.
